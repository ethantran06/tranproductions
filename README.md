# Why Pineapple Belongs on Pizza

## Taste
One may make the argument that fruits don't belong on pizza, but that actually is quite ironic becuase all pizzas are comprised of tomato sauce, which is another form of a fruit. Pineapple's existence transforms pizza to greater lengths that are unexplainable, due to its exquisite umami and one of a kind aroma.

## Aesthetic
Pizza without pineapple is like a baby without its clothes, nobody wants to see it. Its bright, yellow vibrance adds a delicate sight that pleases the eyes, as opposed to any other topping such as an olive, as its black shade can send chills down the spine of anyone who dares to look at it
